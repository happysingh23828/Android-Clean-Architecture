This is a sample movie list  Android application üì± built to demonstrate use of *Clean Architecture* tools. Dedicated to all Android Developers with ‚ù§Ô∏è. 

***You can Install and test latest app from below üëá***

[![Clean Architecture App](https://img.shields.io/badge/CleanArchitectureüç≤-APK-red.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=android)](https://github.com/happysingh23828/Android-Clean-Architecture/raw/master/files/clean-arc.apk)

## - How to build on your environment
Add your API key in **local.properties** file.
```xml
tmdb_api_key = YOUR_API_KEY
```
If you don't have tmdb api key you can create new key from [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

## - About
It simply loads **Popular Movies** list from [TMDB-API](https://www.themoviedb.org/)  and stores it in persistence storage (i.e. Room Database). Movies list will be always loaded from local database. Remote data (from API) and Local data is always synchronized.
It has feature of bookmark movie which will be stored locally.
- Modular approch followed
- It is heavily implemented by following standard clean architecture principle.
- Offline capability.
- It has cache expiration feature [5 minutes].
- Unit testing written for all layers.
- Multi Module Code Coverage reports using Jacoco.
- static code analyses added by using detekt, ktlint.
- Android CI github action integration. 
- [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) priciple followed for more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

### - Disclaimer

Note: The use of clean architecture may seem over-complicated for this sample project. However, this allows us to keep the amount of boilerplate code to a minimum and also demonstrate the approach in a simpler form.

Clean Architecture will not be appropriate for every project, so it is down to you to decide whether or not it fits your needs üôÇ

### What is clean architecture?
Architecture means the overall design of the project. It's the organization of the code into classes or files or components or modules. And it's how all these groups of code relate to each other. The architecture defines where the application performs its core functionality and how that functionality interacts with things like the database and the user interface.

### Why the cleaner approach?
1. Separation of code in different layers with¬†assigned responsibilities making it easier for further modification.
2. High level of¬†abstraction
3. Loose coupling¬†between the code
4. Testing¬†of code is painless
> Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. - by Michael Feathers‚Äù

### Layers
- **Domain** - Would execute business logic which is independent of any layer and is just a pure kotlin/java package with no android specific dependency.
- **Data** - Would dispense the required data for the application to the domain layer by implementing interface exposed by the domain.
- **Presentation / framework** - Would include both domain and data layer and is android specific which executes the UI logic.

## - Modules of App
  ### App 
  It uses the all the components and class releated to Android Framework. It gets the data from presentation layer and shows on UI.
  
  ### BuildSrc
  This module helps to list and manage all the dependencies of the app at one place. It has list of dependencies and versions of that dependencies.
  
  ### Data 
  The Data layer is our access point to external data layers and is used to fetch data from multiple sources (the cache and remote in our case).
  
  ### Cache
  The Cache layer handles all communication with the local database which is used to cache data.
  
  ### Domain
  The domain layer responsibility is to simply contain the UseCase instance used to retrieve data from the Data layer and pass it onto the Presentation layer. 
  
  ### Presentation
  This layer's responsibility is to handle the presentation of the User Interface, but at the same time knows nothing about the user interface itself. This layer has no dependence on the Android Framework, it is a pure Kotlin module. Each ViewModel class that is created implements the ViewModel class found within the Architecture components library. This ViewModel can then be used by the UI layer to communicate with UseCases and retrieve data.
  
  ### Remote
  The Remote layer handles all communications with remote sources, in our case it makes a simple API call using a Retrofit interface. 

## - Code Coverage Reports
This projects uses [jacoco plugin](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/) for generate code coverage reports. currently each modules generates seprate code reports.

  #### Java/Kotlin Modules
  Use `./gradlew jacocoTestReport`
  
  Reports location for each module-<br>
  `-/data/build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`<br>
  `-/domain/build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`<br>
  `-/remote/build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`<br>

  #### Android Modules
  Use `./gradlew jacocoTestReportDebug`

  Reports location for each module-<br>
  `-/app/build/reports/jacoco/debug/index.html`<br>
  `-/cache/build/reports/jacoco/debug/index.html`<br>
  `-/presentattion/build/reports/jacoco/debug/index.html` <br>
 
 
## - Code Quality Checks
This projects uses detekt, ktlint static code analyser and auto formatter in CI/CD pipeline to maintain code quality. they also genrated reports.

  #### Run detekt locally
  Use `./gradlew detekt`
  
  Reports location for each module-<br>
  `-/cache/build/reports/detekt/report.html`<br>
  `-/domain/build/reports/detekt/report.html`<br>
  `-/remote/build/reports/detekt/report.html`<br>

  #### Run ktlint locally
  Use `./gradlew ktlint`

  Reports location for each module-<br>
  `-/app/build/reports/ktlint/ktlint-checkstyle-report.xml`<br>
  `-/cache/build/reports/ktlint/ktlint-checkstyle-report.xml`<br>
  `-/presentattion/build/reports/ktlint/ktlint-checkstyle-report.xml` <br>
 
  #### Run ktlint formatter locally
  Use `./gradlew ktlintFormat`
  

## - Current App's Architecture
This app uses [***MVVM (Model View View-Model)***](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture.

## - Future Plans
1. Add another features, Showing the crew and cast list for a movie. 
2. Instrumentation test cases to be added.
3. Merge all code covergae reports at single place.
4. MvRx implementaion on the UI layer.
5. MVI implementation on the UI layer.
6. Reach code coverage atleast 80%.
7. Dark Mode theme etc.
